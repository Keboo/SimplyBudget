# SimplyBudget
This is a simple application I have developed for my family to manage our [zero sum budget](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/how-to-make-a-zero-based-budget). I am happy to look at bug and pull requests but the primary audiance for this application is me.
You can watch me work on this project as part of my [live streams](https://twitch.keboo.dev) and the records can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/KevinBost/search?query=SimplyBudget)
